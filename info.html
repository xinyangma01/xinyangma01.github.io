          <h3>The Not-So-Long History......</h3>
          <h5>Development</h5>
          <p>
            Under the guidance of Josef Fares, the director behind "A Way Out"
            and "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons," a team of 60 individuals at
            Hazelight Studios collaborated to develop "It Takes Two." Following
            the success of "A Way Out" in 2018, the team decided to embark on
            another cooperative-only game, leveraging their expertise to further
            enhance and expand the gameplay ideas explored in their previous
            creation. The development team placed significant emphasis on
            weaving a seamless connection between the gameplay and the
            narrative, ensuring that the mechanics evolved alongside the
            unfolding story. Josef Fares urged the inclusion of a plethora of
            mechanics and setpieces, driven by his belief that repetition of
            gameplay elements diminishes their uniqueness. With the director
            describing the game as a "romantic comedy," Josef Fares himself
            contributed to the motion capture for a pivotal character, Dr.
            Hakim. The majority of the game's code was penned in AngelScript,
            skillfully integrated into the Unreal Engine through a proprietary
            plugin developed by Hazelight Studios.

          <h5>Plot</h5>
          <p>
            "It Takes Two" follows Cody and May, a couple planning to divorce,
            who get transformed into dolls by their daughter Rose. Guided by Dr.
            Hakim, they embark on a journey to restore their relationship and
            return to their human bodies. Along the way, they rediscover their
            love through collaborative challenges and reminisce about cherished
            memories. Meanwhile, Rose tries to mend their relationship but feels
            responsible for their issues and runs away. After completing Dr.
            Hakim's tests, Cody and May reunite with Rose, reassuring her of
            their unconditional love. The trio returns home with a renewed
            perspective on their bond.

          <h3>Tips and Strategies</h3>
          <p>
            <strong> Wall Jumping for Height</strong><br />
            When struggling to reach higher platforms or solve puzzles, players
            can gain extra height by continuously jumping against nearby walls.
            <br />
            <strong>Color Coordination</strong><br />
            Pay attention to colors in the game. Yellow indicates the next
            objective, green is favorable, and red signifies potential dangers.
            <br />
            <strong>Dual Puzzles</strong><br />
            Puzzles will often require both players to perform different tasks
            simultaneously. Always be proactive and look for tasks nearby when
            your partner is engaged in one.
            <br />
            <strong>Crouching for Solutions</strong><br />
            Crouching is essential for solving various puzzles, allowing players
            to access hidden areas or retrieve objects required for progress.
            <br />
            <strong>Discover Boss Weaknesses</strong><br />
            Each boss has unique weaknesses. Players must observe carefully to
            find and exploit these weaknesses during boss battles.
            <br />
            <strong>Effective Coordination</strong><br />
            As a cooperative game, players must communicate and coordinate
            effectively to make progress smoothly.
            <br />
            <strong>Resurrecting Partners</strong><br />
            If one player dies, the other can revive them by pressing buttons
