          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Xinyang Ma and I'm currently in my second semester at
            Seneca. I used to be a full-time jewelry designer and maker. I have
            my own business and it was going pretty well. But I always have a
            passion for programming and I wanted to give it a try. Plus, doing
            my own business were both mentally and physically demanding.
            However, I won't give up on jewelry-making completely. Actually I'm
            still doing it on the side. That's a sweet spot I'd like to keep.
            I'm enjoying programming right now. I especially have a passion for
            web dev. And I wish to become a web developer after graduation.
            <br />
            I chose this game because it's the best game I ever played,
            Immersive, enlightening and aesthetically pleasing. I played this
            gamw with my boyfriend. It didn't take much longer for us to clear
            the game. And we played it over and over again until we knew exactly
            what's going to happen next. But we just can't resist it. It
            challenges you with right amount of puzzles and joys. It's not so
            hard that you need to look up for tips and tricks and finally give
            up but it's not too easy that you feel like this game was designed
            for kindergarten kids. whenver I feel mentally exhausted or I feel
            like I could use some help to escape reality, I play this game. I
            like to immerse myself in the breakingtakingly beautiful scenes and
            interesting plots and just forget about everything for now. It's
            like a remedy to me.
